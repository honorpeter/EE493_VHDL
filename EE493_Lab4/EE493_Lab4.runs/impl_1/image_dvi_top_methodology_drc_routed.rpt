TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_200_out_clk_40_200MHz_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_200_out_clk_40_200MHz_clk_wiz_0_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_200_out_clk_40_200MHz_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_200_out_clk_40_200MHz_clk_wiz_0_1_1]
